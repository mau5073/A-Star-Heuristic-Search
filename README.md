# A-Star-Heuristic-Search
Project in intro AI course 

This project was introduced after covering various search techniques. The project asked to implement our own version of the A star search algorithm. The program can be used in console but was meant to be used in the path finding environment.

Search Space:  The world is represented by an M-by-N 2-dimensional grid.  M and N are not necessarily the same.

Each grid cell can be referred to by its row and column coordinates.

One grid cell is marked as the initial location (in blue), and another cell is marked as the goal location (in red).  All cells marked in gray are obstacles (not passable).

Only four actions are allowed in this problem: move left by 1, move right by 1, move up by 1, and move down by 1.  No diagonal movements are allowed.

You program should find a solution, which is a sequence of grid locations that leads to the goal location.
